        <p>These fluffy and flavorful pancakes are made with simple ingredients that you likely already have in your pantry, so you can whip them up in no time.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>Whisk together milk and vinegar in a separate bowl and let sit for a few minutes until the mixture curdles.</li>
            <li>Add melted butter and vanilla extract to the milk mixture and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough pancakes.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Use a ladle or measuring cup to scoop the batter onto the skillet, making pancakes of your desired size.</li>
            <li>Cook until bubbles appear on the surface of the pancake, then flip and cook for an additional minute or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter or oil to the skillet as needed.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with your favorite toppings, such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</li>
            </ol>
